# Architecture and Design Of The Web Application, Including User Interface Mockups

Architecture:

Client-Server Model: Web application follows a client-server model where the browser (client) communicates with the server to fetch data and perform actions.
Frontend: Developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for dynamic user interfaces.
Backend: Built with Node.js and Python, utilizing frameworks like Express.js. Handles client requests, interacts with the database, and performs business logic.
Database: MongoDB.
API: Flask.
Authentication and Authorization: Implements user authentication and authorization using session-based authentication.

User Interface (UI) Design: Modern design principles ensure a clean and intuitive layout, focusing on usability and accessibility.
Responsive Design: Ensures seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Color Scheme and Branding: Consistent with branding guidelines for a visually appealing interface.
Navigation: Simple and intuitive navigation with clear labels and organized menus for easy user navigation.
Forms and Input Fields: Designed for usability with clear instructions and feedback for users.
Error Handling: Provides helpful error messages and feedback for resolving issues.
Mockups: Illustrative mockups for key pages such as the homepage, user profile page, and settings page.

# EEG Dataset and Code Explanation

This repository contains code for analyzing EEG (Electroencephalography) signals for two different tasks: Few-shot EEG learning and Imagined speech classification. Additionally, it includes a dataset downloaded from the [provided link](https://osf.io/pq7vb/), which consists of EEG recordings for these tasks.

# User Story: Easy Navigation and Feature Understanding for EEG Speech Classification
To ensure the EEG speech classification web application meets user needs and acceptance criteria, here's a summary of the plan:

Clear Navigation:

Implement a well-organized navigation menu with descriptive labels.
Use dropdown menus or nested navigation for advanced features.
Intuitive User Interface:

Design a simple and clear interface with familiar UI elements.
Provide visual cues to indicate interactive elements.
Ensure consistency in UI elements and layout across all pages.
Provide feedback to users for their actions.

Testing and Feedback:

Conduct usability testing with target users.
Gather feedback to refine the interface iteratively.

## Note

- **Early Stage Project**: It's important to note that this repository is in the initial phase of development. There are upcoming sprints planned to further enhance the project.
- Your feedback and contributions are welcome as we continue to refine the codebase and dataset analysis. Feel free to reach out to the repository owner or contributors with any suggestions or questions.
